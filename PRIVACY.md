# Privacy Policy for HomeTab Launcher

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Data Collection
HomeTab Launcher ("the Extension") **does not collect, transmit, or sell any user data**. 
All data created by the user (custom shortcuts, titles, icons, preferences) is stored **locally** on the user's device using the browser's built-in `chrome.storage.local` API.

## Permissions Usage
The Extension uses the following permissions for functional purposes only:

1.  **Storage (`storage`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: To save your dashboard layout, custom shortcuts, and preferences.
    *   **Data Handling**: Data is stored locally and, if you are signed into your browser, synced across your devices using Chrome/Edge Sync (`chrome.storage.sync`). This synchronization is handled securely by your browser provider (Google/Microsoft) and is subject to their respective privacy policies. We do not have access to this data.

2.  **Favicon**:
    *   **Purpose**: To display icons for your shortcuts.
    *   **Data Handling**: The extension fetches icons directly from the website URL or Google's public favicon service (`www.google.com/s2/favicons`). No user browsing history is tracked or stored.

## Third-Party Services
The Extension operates entirely client-side. It does not communicate with any analytics services, ad networks, or external servers managed by the developer.
